# Where in the world?

[Where in the world](http://alltheworld.zeroff.tech/) is a small project created to practice work with API, [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [React-Router v6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6). I`ve made this app as a solution to a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) challenge "REST Countries API with color theme switcher". Basic logics and routing are provided.

App is running on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) framework.

To increase user expirience I`ve added responsive design by using [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) library.

## Available features

- You can see all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an input field
- Filter countries by region
- You can click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Try to click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Also you can toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode

### Usage

You can try this project on your own server (or localhost):
In the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
